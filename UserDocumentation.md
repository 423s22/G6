<h1> Documentation for users </h1>
<h2> Projectâ€™s goal </h2>

<ul> the goal is to create an app plugin for Shopify. 
It can be used in conjunction with other apps to create the user 
experience that the shop holder wishes for. The main functionality 
of our app is that the user can see the overall sum of the product 
when additional changes to the product are made. i.e., a necklace 
that has a leaf pendent can have the gemstones and metal type changed
and with each change the overall price will be updated before the user 
moves it to cart. </ul>

<h2> To install the app, you will need a Shopify account </h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Installing through the Shopify App Store<ul>
    <li> Login into the Shopify App Store </li>
    <li> Find the app and click on it </li>
    <li> On the app listing page, add app. </li> 
  <li> In your Shopify admin, authorize the use of the app by clicking install app </li> </ul>

## Add Engraving Option Tutorial (partially functional)

The following is meant to be a tutorial of how to add a custom engraving option to your Shopify product.

**Note**: The user is only able to follow this tutorial until the *Submit* option on the *Engraving* form. Currently, the user interface for this capability has not been connected to the backend. Also note that while there is also a *Radio Button* option displayed on the *Option Types* dropdown menu, this option has yet to be implemented. 

1. First navigate to the *Add Options* page using the navigation tabs. 
2. Once you have successfully directed to the *Add Options* page, click on the *Select options* button to open the product selector. 

![Add Options page](https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/screenshots/add-options-page.png)

3. In the product selector, select the product you would like to add options to. For this tutorial, we will be selecting the *Winter Frost* product. Once you are ready to proceed, click *Add*.

*Select the Winter Frost product from within the product selector*

4. After clicking *Add* from within the product selector, you will be directed to option type selection. On this page, you are able to see the product you have selected. If you would like to cancel and return to product selection, you click the *X* on the product card. 
6. Now we will click on the `Option Types` dropdown menu to selecting `Engraving` as our option.

![Option type selection](https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/screenshots/option-type-selection.png)
*Option type selection. Select Engraving from the dropdown menu*

6. Now click the *Add Option* button to be directed to the Engraving option form.

![Engraving option form](https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/screenshots/engraving-option-form.png)
*Engraving option form. Here is where we select line number, add a description of the option, and add any additional price associated with the option.*

7. On the *Engraving* form, we can select the number of lines we would like. We can also add a custom description of the option, as well as any additional cost/price associated with the option. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the default options of 1 line of engraving and a price of 0. We will also refrain from adding a custom description.

8. Now we can click *Submit* to add the option to our product. 

**Note**: *Submit* is **not currently functional** as the backend development is still in progress.
