<h1> Documentation for users </h1>
<h2> Projectâ€™s goal </h2>

<ul> The goal is to create an embedded app for Shopify. 
It can be used in conjunction with other apps to create the user 
experience that the shop holder wishes for. The main functionality 
of our app is that the user can see the overall sum of the product 
when additional changes to the product are made. i.e., a necklace 
that has a leaf pendent can have the gemstones and metal type changed
and with each change the overall price will be updated before the user 
moves it to cart. </ul>
