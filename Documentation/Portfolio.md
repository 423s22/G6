<h2> I. Program </h2> 
<p> 
	Over this past semester, our group worked with a client to develop an app for Shopify. Shopify is an eCommerce platform for online stores and creates a point of sales system for many businesses. Our client has their own site to sell their custom products, but they also aid other business owners to set up their own Shopify. However, our client ran into issues when setting up their store that ruined their user experience. The main issue is the client was unable to update the overall price of their products once the user made their modifications to the product. That being said, our client's customers are unable to see the price of the product until they are checking out, it is incredibly frustrating for both the client and the customer. 
	To alleviate these issues we have created a custom app for the user. When the user first opens the app they are directed to the homepage.

<h2> II. Teamwork </h2>
<p> Throughout this project, we have faced many challenges and we have worked together to redesign the project to get the best product for our client. At first, our group was three people, and we found the product would best meet our clients needs if we combined the group previously known as “G7”.  Our decision to expand our team reflects our ability to work together and create the best solution for the client. While stopping for a day to get everyone on the same page for the project seemed taunting, it allowed our group to overcome greater problems in our overall design. </p>

<h4> Will Cook: </h4>
<p> Throughout this project, I have focused on the CI(Continuous Integration) testing in Github and the overall database integration. I build the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions for the database using MySQL and Node.js. This was integrated into the groups Heroku app for the application using ClearDB(heroku app extension). For me, this project has been a steep learning curve as I have never used Javascript, React, or the Rest API. Although I have struggled with some tasks, my experience with databases has helped to combat errors I developed while working. We chose these languages for a couple reasons, some were required to work with the Shopify platform and MySQL was chosen for the memory, storage, and speed used when accessing the database. During the database creation, I was required to reformat the style used for storing or accessing the database. This was because I misunderstood what was needed and how databases were executed in Javascript. The level of logic required for the database was reduced to fit a usable but attainable scope within the amount of time left available for the project. My group members have been patient with the bugs with the database, and assisted in the final product for a working product. I also assisted in the later versions of the UML class and sequence diagram which include the database connections. As the project deadline closes in, it will continue to be refined and improved for a better customer experience. Contributions can be viewed on Github, but as of April 14th I have tracked 96 hours and completed 62 work hour units. My assigned tasks can be found in the group jira backlog and bi-weekly sprints.  </p>

<h4> Lenin Lewis: </h4>
<p> In the duration of the project, we each took on taks that held interest to us. Since I had little experience with javascript and implentemtning UI design, I wanted to use this semester to expand and hone my skills. First I took on designing and making both the homepage and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages for our Shopify app. The FAQ page is essential for the user experience, since there will not be a support team in place once the app is released. The FAQ page has design elements, including boxes around each question and a label in the search bar to improve the users experience; it was kept simple to alleviate any future user errors. The homepage followed the same philosophy, keep it a simple and intuitive desgin. The homepage entails of  the appropriate buttons to direct the user to any source they may need. In the coding backlog, the app UI will continue to be refined as user testing is companced, and the backlog entails implementing unit tesitng.  Lastly, once the group completes our product branding we will add the logo and design choices (i.e. color) into the current UI. Outside of the coding portion of the project, I worked on UML documentation, the design pattern, user documentation, and orginizing the portfolio through the semester. At this moment in time the UML documentation (https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/Documentation/UMLDocumentation.md#-uml-documentation-of-shopify-app-and-design-decisions-made-) shows the frontend code design in a class, object, and sequence diagram, and the backlong task is to complete the UML documentation of our backend code. Next, I worked on the design pattern for the project. A decorator pattern was selected since the price will need to be updated based off how the client wants to change the product they are buying. Thus far you can see the class diagram of the decorator pattern in the UML documention (https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/Documentation/UMLDocumentation.md#-decorate-pattern-) . The decorator pattern is outlined depth in the section 3 (https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/Documentation/Portfolio.md#-iii-design-pattern-) of the paper. Lastly, the portfolio and user documentions have been a living documents throughout the semester. This choice was made, so the progression of the app could be recorded and referenced by any user. The workload and hours put into tasks listed above has been tracked through our burndown chart (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qWjqU1w1oxYyYeYFQ7EqP9aI5dt4SIy14x6kxzEHuD4/edit?usp=sharing). The chart currently shows that we are off track from our expected progress. However, the chart does not account for the hours I spent struggling to get through the Shopify documentation, getting ngrok to work on my local machine, and time we spent to reconfigure our group. Since we saw the gap widing between work completed and work we expected to complete, the another group was combined into our group. I believe in the next two weeks will we watch the gap between the workloads narrow as we complete even more of the project.  </p>

<h4> James Marsh: </h4>
<p> In the first phase of the project, Team Member 5 was a part of Group 7 (alongside Team Members 4 and 6). For that project, TM5 did the intial app setup, created a development store, registerd the app, and set up the git repository to meet the Shopify CLI requirements. They also create the first draft of the Systems Design UML for the project, working with Member Four on the design. Once the app was set up for local testing, Member Five deployed it to the cloud hosting platform that the group decided upon, Heroku. The key task TM5 volunteered for in Sprint 3 was the implementation of the postgreSQL database, and the nodeJS server for the project. PostgreSQL was chosen because it had good support on Heroku, while being relatively compatible with the mySQL data storage used in Shopify. Throughout this first set of sprints, the Shopify environment turned into a larger and larger hurdle, restricting the design space of the application in order to accomodate Shopify's constraints. The way they handle their product details & pricing, and the way applications are deployed to customers both made our initial plans to meet the client's design requests unfeasible. But hey, if the existing platform could easily do what the client wanted, they wouldn't need our help in the first place! In Sprint 4, Groups 6 and 7 decided to merge together to create one application, in the hope that combined efforts would help overcome the design constraints within the project timeline. During this most recent sprint, TM5 began working on the part of our app that is injected into store page for each product & the shopping cart with TM4. Working together with TM2 and TM4 to integrate the store page with the backend, the group discovered the largest blocker with Shopify: any code pushed to the store page is publicly visible, and thus unable to send private requests to the server or database for pricing changes. This resulted in a need to refactor the data handling on the merchant end, in order to create safe public routes for customers to add custom products to their cart. So far, TM5 has spent 78 hours on the two projects, with 55 workload units completed. </p>

<h4> Alyssa Newhart:  </h4>
<p>  During this project, I focused mainly on the initial setup of the application and the front end development of our Add Options page, which contains the core functionality of our app. Since I have an interest in learning more about how Shopify apps are created, I took on the task of writing the base app code for the front end and back end of our application using React, Next.js, and Node.js. I then embedded the app into our Shopify development store and created the corresponding Heroku app for our application. I also created the wireframe for the UI of our application, on which we based the front end of the application. I then took on the task of creating the Add Options page and its subsequent React components and their CSS styles, in order to strengthen and enhance my knowledge of and experience in front end development using React. The React components for the Add Options page were created using a mix of custom components and Shopify’s Polaris React components. We chose to use Shopify’s Polaris React components within our application in order to match the styling of the Shopify Admin dashboard itself, to provide a consistent and familiar UI experience for the user. The Add Options page of our application is where the user can select a product, view currently applied options, remove currently applied options, and add either a new engraving or dropdown menu option. The engraving option allows the user to add up to 5 lines of engraving, while the dropdown option allows the user to create a custom dropdown menu with an unlimited number of custom options. We chose to only allow these two options choices to the user, given the current time frame and scope of the project. Since the Add Options components responsible for adding a new option, displaying applied options, and removing an applied option, rely on the database for storing and retrieving product information, I also helped to connect the front end components with the database. I also wrote the initial developer documentation for the setup of our application within Shopify, and have continuously helped my group members to troubleshoot various bugs that arose from Shopify’s authentication methods and version requirements. I have also continued to update the user documentation upon the completion of features within the application. My full coding contributions and documentation contributions to the project can be viewed in our GitHub repository, my hours spent vs. work hours completed can be viewed in my team’s burndown chart, as of April 13, I have worked 99 hours and completed 67 work hour units. My backlog tasks signed up for and completed can be viewed in our team’s Jira project (if the link is not working, you can navigate to our board, then perform a search on issues, filter by done, and assignee. </p>

<h4> Riley Slater:   </h4>
<p> I worked on front-end tests using Jest snapshots and the theme extension code with James. There were some configuration issues with babel and our nextJS but once I got them sorted it was smooth sailing. Babel is used by Jest to transpile anything that is not common JS making it pretty necessary to use. While snapshot testing is not as rigorous as integration testing. It will work for the scope of this project and provide us the feedback we need to diagnose errors during development. The theme extension code that James and I have been working on has been pretty tricky to navigate. We are hitting blockers left and right due to the limitations of Shopify and constantly having to figure out work arounds. </p>

<h4> Daniel Vinogradov:  </h4>
<p>Our original group G7 merged with G6, which meant we needed to delegate each other new tasks. The work Daniel, I, was delegated to was strictly front end. I developed a mock store, filled it with images, descriptions, created products, collections and incorporated Lenin's menus to design the store. The theme of our store is an outdoors apparel and equipment store known as Eagle Apparel. I also was assigned to create a brand, logo and story for our theme. The store uses the theme Venture, the free version, available from the Shopify Theme store. This theme is great because the theme has constant updates, meaning if we want to change our store to a different theme, we are not restricted sticking to older versions of themes. </p>

<h2> III. Design Pattern </h2>
<p> In the deisgn pattern for the assignment we went with a decorator pattern for our overall desgin. Following our UML documentation 
page, it shows how the design have interacted with each other: https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/UMLDocumentation.md#-decorate-pattern- </p>
