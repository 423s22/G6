<h2> I. Program </h2> 
<p> 
	Over this past semester our group worked with a client to develop an app for Shopify. Shopify is an ecommerce platform for online stores and creating a point of sales system for many businesses. Our client has their own site to sell their custom products, but they also aid other business owners to set up their own Shopify. However, our client ran into issues when setting up their store that ruined their user experience. The main issue is the client was unable to update the overall price of their products once the user made their modifications to the product. That being said, our clients' customers are unable to see the price of the product until they are checking out, it is incredibly frustrating for both the client and the customer. 
	To alleviate these issues we have created a custom app for the user. When the user first opens the app they are directed to the homepage. </p>

<h2> II. Teamwork </h2>
<p> Throughout this project each member took on roles that interested them, and allowed them to take past knowledge from their education to complete their task. Will mainly focused on the configuring of continuous development between our GitHub repository and our Heroku application, and our database code and Heroku configuration. Alyssa set up the base app code for the frontend and backend, and embedded the app into our Shopify development store, and created the corresponding Heroku app for our application. She also created the initial wireframe for our UI flow and then created the Add Options page as well as the corresponding Add Options components, logic, and styles. She also configured authenticated fetch between the front end and the backend. She also wrote the initial setup of the developer documentation in regards to application setup within Shopify and also wrote an updated version of the user documentation corresponding to the Beta Release. Lenin focused on the user Homepage, frequently asked question page, user documentation in regards to  interacting with the app, and UML documentation. Next all members in the group worked on testing and tracking bugs in the system. </p> 

<h2> III. Design Pattern </h2>
<p> In the deisgn pattern for the assignment we went with a decorator pattern for our overall desgin. Following our UML documentation 
page, it shows how the design have interacted with each other: https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/UMLDocumentation.md#-decorate-pattern- </p>
