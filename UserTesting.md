# User Testing Outline

**Testing Goal:**
The goal of these tests are to gauge the intuitiveness and comprehension of our custom options Shopify application. Through the conduction of two separate one-hour user testing sessions, we hope to glean valuable insight into which features of our application meet user needs and which features need to be adjusted. We also aim to address any bugs that should be uncovered through user testing. 

**Background:**
Each user testing session will last for roughly one hour. First, we will select two participants who have no previous knowledge of computer science or our system, in order to address the common user. 

The user testing sessions will be monitored by the group, however, only one member will act as the interviewer/moderator. The rest of the members will be silently observing and taking notes.

**Interview:**
The interview will begin with some introductory questions that aim to measure the amount of familiarity the user has with Shopify in general, and how it works.

The user will then be prompted with the testing scenario. This scenario will be [insert testing scenario here]. After asking any clarifying questions they may have, the user will then be given the user documentation as well as their tasks [insert tasks here] for interacting with the system.
The user will be encouraged to think aloud and narrate their process, along with any concerns or frustrations they may encounter. However, the moderator/interviewer will not interfere during the task process unless explicitly called on by the user. 

The user’s progress and feedback will be continuously recorded during the interview and will be used to improve the system upon testing completion. 

After the user has completed the tasks, they will then be posed some closing questions. These closing questions will aim to uncover any missed concerns or likes about the system, and will comprise of questions such as “What did you like about the app? What did you dislike about the app? and, What would you do differently if you were in charge of designing the application?.”
