    2) Refresh the Options page
    3) Remove one of the options 
    4) Refresh the Options page

5) Navigate back to the `Homepage`
6) Natigate to the `FAQ` page
   1) Search the term "Options app"
### Phase 2: Interview

5)	What did you think about the dropdown option?
    1)	They liked how simple it was to add options and to apply prices to all products. However, they wished there was the option to press enter or press a button to add options.

 ## User Background

User 2 is a student at MSU with a double major in Accounting and Finance. This user frequently uses technology in their day to day and would consider themselves as tech savvy. The user has some experience with retail work, but they have never set up the database for a store. Entering this test, the user felt confident critiquing the design elements from experiences in their degree. 
 
 ## Results 
 Part of the results from this user test can be noted in the interview response questions located above(https://github.com/423s22/G6/blob/main/userTesting/UserTest1.md#phase-2-interview). In addition to the interview questions the user was able to use the app with little difficulty. The user did feel confused a few times when using the app, they contributed this being their first time working with this software.

 ## Analysis
 This user test had fewer notable challenges within the tests. The user had more issues with wording within the app then features in the app itself. The problem with the wording is important to note because it slowed the user from completing the tasks. The FAQ page also affected the users testing since the bright colors distracted the user, and the user felt as if they were on a different website since the colors did not line up. 
 
 ## Software Changes
1) Change wording on a few buttons on the homepage change “Listed Products” to “Create Options” and “FAQ”
2)	When adding data to the “dropdown option” have the user be able to press enter and have a button to press
3)	Change the wording “Price $” to “Set Price”
4)	In dropdown menu create better wording for selecting the option, it is currently the name of the product in question
5)	Change “Applied Options” to “View Options” to view and “Close View Options” to close the page
6)	Change the color of the FAQ bar, the blue was too bright
7)	The boxes in the FAQ should all be flushed with the boarder
